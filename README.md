## Supplementary Material for "Identifying Melodic Motifs and Stable Notes from Gestural Information in Indian Vocal Performances", Proceedings of TISMIR 2024

## Abstract

Manual gesture plays an important role in Indian classical singing, and one of its functions is to
support, illustrate or communicate aspects of raga melody. We explore the relationship between
hand movements and melodic elements in Indian classical vocal performances, using kinematic
data to classify stable notes and raga-specific phrases. Our findings reveal consistent gestural
patterns across singers, with potential applications in gesture-based music analysis.
