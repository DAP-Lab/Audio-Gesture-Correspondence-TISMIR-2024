Here we put two examples (30s snippets) out of the aalaps considered for stable note classification. Both singers (MP and SM) have a relatively high percentage of stable notes in their singing but the SVM performance for MP is far better than that for SM. The reasons for this are attribute to the following characteristics in their gestures:

MP’s actions are highly correlated with the singing, including sudden movements in places where the note suddenly changes as well as zero velocity in places of long steady notes. It is as if the hands are following the notes, as can be seen in the 30 s example provided.

Stable note timestamps:
0:07-0:10
0:11-0:14
0:23-0:26

SM’s right wrist is stationary for most part of her aalaps (although in the produced example over some parts both hands are moving), while her left wrist is moving at in a way that is hardly correlated with the notes. For example, there is a fast movement of the wrist even for the steady notes (speed being comparable to the nonsteady counterparts). So it is extremely difficult to predict the kind of note sung from the wrist movement, unlike for MP whose movements are extremely systematic.
