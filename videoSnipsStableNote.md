Here we put two examples (30s snippets) out of the aalaps considered for stable note classification. Both singers (MP and SM) have a relatively high percentage of stable notes in their singing but the SVM performance for MP is far better than that for SM. The reasons for this are attribute to the following characteristics in their gestures:

Singer AG
----------

For AG, the gestures are consistent with the stability of notes. For stable notes, the hands are quite steady while for non stable notes they are moving.

Singer SS
----------

For SS, the gestures are inconsistent with the pitch stability. She is moving her hands constantly in minimal ways for both stable and nonstable notes.
