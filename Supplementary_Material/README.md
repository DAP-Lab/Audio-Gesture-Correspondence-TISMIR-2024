# Supplementary Material

This folder contains a subfolder (Videos) containing video snippets aimed at demonstrating our findings. 
Please find the explanation about them in the document Videos.pdf. (Please note: Links to video folders in the PDF work
only when the PDF is downloaded, not through Github. Alternatively, you can manually find the corresponding location
of the video snippet in this repository folder). The document Figures_and_Tables.pdf contains extra plots and results
accompanying those reported in the paper.
