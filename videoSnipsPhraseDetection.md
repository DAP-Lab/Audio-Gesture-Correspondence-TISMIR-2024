Here we provide some examples for the phrase based classification using gesture. We provide the results based on the phrase P\R and using the best performing model for that phrase. 

We provide three sets of samples:-

[Pakad Templates] (Pakad_Templates.md) - This is the full set of pakad templates for this phrase.

[Audio Like Gesture Like] (Audio_Like_Predicted_Gesture_Like.md) - This has 4 examples of correctly predicted occurences from the gesture

[Audio Like Predicted Gesture Unlike] (Audio_Like_Predicted_Gesture_Unlike.md) - This has  4 examples of incorrectly predicted occurences where examples which were identified as Like in audio were predicted as Unlike in gesture.

Our comments on this are:-

1. We observe for the pakad templates except for SS all the singers have a clear motion from the top right towards their body. This is especially prominent for CC and to a lesser extent for AP. AK also has the same but at a much smaller scale. SS has a peculiar motion and is primarily via her fingers with the wrist being in almost fixed position so that it is unlikely to be picked up by the gesture coordinates. 

2.  For the predicted correctly examples, there is a similar motion of the hand moving towards the body which is perhaps indicative of why the gesture based classifier picked them correctly.

3.  On the other hand, in the ones predicted incorrectly the singers use a more complicated hand motion.
